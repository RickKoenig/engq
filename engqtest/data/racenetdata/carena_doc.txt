PHW resurrection.

This document explains some of the settings for carena.exe (full on rally / head2head).


Prep...............................
Find the files on your harddrive..
Creating these shortcuts will make it easier to find the files at a different time.

Onn some system's the file is in 'c:\windows\system32\macromed\shockwave 10\dswmedia'

First find location of the carena.exe file. (Start, search, put carena.exe into 
	'All or part of filename'
Hit search.
Right click on result and 'open containing folder'.
Create a shortcut of the folder  on the desktop by dragging the folder icon in the top/left of the window
onto the desktop.
Make a shortcut of carena.exe and place on the desktop

Go into a subfolder 'sledca'

Look for and go into a subsubfolder 'onlineopt'

right click on a file called 'online_seltrackcfg.txt' and create a shortcut.
Drag the shortcut to the desktop.

Go up a folder back to 'sledca'

got to a subfolder 'config'

right click on a file called 'config.txt' and create a shortcut and drag to desktop.

go up a folder back to 'dswmedia'

At this point there otta be 4 shortcuts on the desktop.
right click on the desktop and make a folder called carena
drag the 4 shortcuts into this folder.
open folder

a note about the .txt files
most lines have a word followed by a number, this is how the many settings are set.
anything after a # is a comment, the program ignores # and the rest of the line.

config/config.txt .............................

alter these to lines in the file to read
	beforeloadtimeoutserver 90 # seconds for waiting around for initial connections
	beforeloadtimeoutclient 150 # seconds for waiting around for initial connections
this will give the connection more time to connect before resorting to bots..

onlineopt/online_seltrack.cfg ............................

altering this file will let you set the kind of game you want to play.

	onlinetracknum anumber
pick a number from 1 to 5
# 1 kevin, 4 player track man made hitech (headon)
# 2 jeff, 2 player track dirt canyons (thefalls)
# 3 jeff revision, rick small track, torus (stayon)
# 4 jeff track vs, cool track, using this until #6 gets fixed, LAI revision (crashsite)
# 5 small track from kevin sphere, CHRIS revision (whaleon)

	rules anumber
# 1 no weapons
#2 weapons

There are 3 connection modes that can be set.
Between the lines in the file,  'rules' and 'carname', the following can be set.
Substitute the 16 example  (the max) for however many players will play. (2-16)
For multiplayer net gamplay, there will be 1 server and 1-15 clients.
Server handles all network traffic between all players and should have the fastest connection and the least firewalled.
If the server quits, the rest of the players silently become botgames.
If a client quits, that one player silently becomes a bot for all the other players

BOTGAME:

	numplayers 1
	numcars 16
play a 16 player bot game.

SERVER: (fast 'waiting for other players to connect' coming together)
	numplayers 16 # these 2 numbers must match, server decides how many players the game will have.
	numcars 16
	port 202020 # actually this is port 5412, (202020 mod 65536  equals 5412)
if you have a firewall, unblock this port
wait 90 seconds (see above 90), for 15 CLIENTS to connect. then play.
if 15 CLIENTS don't connect the the remaining players will be bots.
find out what your IPaddress is and jot it down, you might have a static (never changing) or 
dynamic (changes whenever you disconnect from the net) ip address.
if you don't know your ip, try 
	www.yourip.us/
	www.myip.dk/
in your favorite browser. (ff)
tell all your clients what your IP address is. (I.M.)

CLIENT: (slow 'waiting for other players to connect' coming together)
	numplayers -1
	numcars 16
	serverip 123.65.32.23 # actually the ip of the server you want to connect to
	port 202020 # actually port 5412
try to connect to SERVER, wait 150 seconds (see above 150) for SERVER to reply.
if no reply then start a 16 player botgame.

	carname yourname
	carbody yourcarbody
	carpaint yourpaint
	cardecal whatdecal
	altcarname abotname
etc...
